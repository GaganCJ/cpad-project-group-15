# Smart Warranty Tracker Application
A Cross Platform Application Development Assignment from Group 15 of MTech BITS WILP.

Smart warranty tracker software is a mobile and web-based best-in-class solution to gain a
strategic view of product and warranty service knowledge. Users do not need to remember
about warranty renewal or expiry. This can protect them from unexpected / unpredictable
repair costs, thus providing financial help. Smart warranty not only helps to keep track of
warranty but also provides an additional benefit as a one stop solution to track all the
appliances and their respective bills.
